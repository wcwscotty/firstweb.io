            <p>I love cats. There was a random single cat in my backyard and whenever I would have leftovers, I would always give it to her. 
                Months later she had two kittens, one grew up to be big, the other one grew up to be small and with a small tail. 
                The small cat turned out to be our #1 pet cat. But this website will not be about my cats, just random cat pictures.</p>
